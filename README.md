## Customization the chart appearnce
We can customize the chart appearnce using [header](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/header), [gridlines](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/axis#grid-lines), [axis line](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/axis#axisline), [series palatte](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/appearance#palettes), [angle](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/axis#axis-labels).

## Customize the chart using annotation
We can use [annotation](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/annotations) instances to add context within a specific chart area, here [positioning](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/annotations#positioning-the-annotation) the text based on pixels.

## Customize the chart using interactivity
[Trackball](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/interactive-features/trackball), which allows you to track a data point closer to the cursor. Additionally, you can customize the trackball using the [TrackBallLabelTemplate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_TrackBallLabelTemplate). Using [PositionChanged](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartTrackBallBehavior.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartTrackBallBehavior_PositionChanged) event to retrieve the cursor's data points. Then, we'll bind these data points to a text block.

## Troubleshooting
